# networkx-graph-exercises

Hands-on exercises and small experiments with **graphs** using **Python** and **NetworkX**.  
This repository collects my practice work for a university course related to **Network Science / Information Retrieval**, with a focus on understanding concepts by implementing them on real graphs.

## Goals
- Get confident with the basics of graph theory through code
- Learn how to model and analyze graphs using **NetworkX**
- Practice common network metrics and algorithms (centrality, shortest paths, etc.)
- Build a clean, reproducible workflow for small Python projects

## Contents (work in progress)
Typical topics covered in the exercises:
- Creating graphs (undirected/directed, weighted/unweighted)
- Reading graphs from edge lists / adjacency matrices
- Basic statistics: number of nodes/edges, degree distribution
- Paths and distances: shortest paths, connected components
- Centrality measures: degree, betweenness, closeness, PageRank
- Visualization (basic plots)
- Small experiments and sanity checks on toy graphs and real datasets (when available)

> Note: the repository grows over time as I complete new exercises.

## Project structure (suggested)
Depending on the evolution of the exercises, the structure may look like:
